## Introduction

Please start by reading our [license](https://github.com/whosramoss/clean-dart-github/blob/master/LICENSE) and [code-of-conduct](https://github.com/whosramoss/clean-dart-github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you don't agree with them, this isn't your project.

## Expectations

- We're **mentoring** but just to a certain degree. An initial effort should have been done, training in programming basics or computer science isn't part of the offer. We want to speed up development, not slowing it down.
- **Quality** has priority, not getting quickly done. Faults by unnecessary hurry or sentences like "at least it works" are the opposite of "being welcome" here. Putting experiments on users is disrespectful for their time investment.
- Don't get emotional, act logical. **Personal taste** has to back off if there's no explanation why _xy_ makes more sense for others too. Let's combine the best of all!
- Contributing should happen as **teamwork**, not as competition. Join discussions, look through PRs and issues, merge compatible forks. Ignoring the progress of others leads to lost time (and motivation).

## Style guideline

- Continue present **conventions** and follow **best practices**. Don't break our pattern, code needs no multi-culture.
- **Comment and document** your changes. Keep in mind others may work on same project parts too and don't want to spend much time understanding what you've done. 10 seconds you saved costs another contributor 10 minutes.
- **Include unit tests** when you contribute _new features_, as they help to:
  1. prove that your code works correctly
  2. guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost
- _Bug fixes_ also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
- **Format your code** using the standard provider `linter`.

## What we're looking for

- Bug fixes
- Feature ideas
- Examples or tutorials
- Tests

## How to contribute

Main contribution ways are to [open issues](https://github.com/whosramoss/clean-dart-github/issues) and [fork with later pull requests](https://github.com/whosramoss/clean-dart-github/network/members). Furthermore, you can discuss issues, review **PRs** or mention this project in _public/chat_ with the community about your experience.

If you want to contribute with a pull request, please remember to:

- Fork the repository.
- Check if your changes are consistent with the [style guideline](#style-guideline).

## Community

The community has a high value for this project!

As much as possible should be discussed in public, important decisions made by multiple individuals and people not getting excluded just because of a little dispute.
